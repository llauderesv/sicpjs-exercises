Chapter 1
Recursion vs Iterative Process

In this chapter, I learned how to properly used the recursive process vs iterative process.
Knowing this two concept gives you the idea when not to use recursive process, since recursive process gives computer process grows more O(n). Compared to Iterative process. It's a constant time the only thing you need to do is to create a variable that holds the current value of the iteration to keep track O(1).
